'''
Find a corpus (either a simple text corpus, or a corpus that has been tagged with part-of-speech tags).
Learn a language model from that corpus. You can do this simply on the basis of the words, or on the basis of the words and their part-of-speech tags, as in your example.
Generate all possible sequences of your target words.
Use the language model to compute the probabilities of all those sequences.
Pick the sequence with the highest probability.
