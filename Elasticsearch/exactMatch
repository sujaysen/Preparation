For exact match we need to use Keyword Analyzer - This will keep the entire field as one string.





** tokenizer

1. ngrams analyzer
2. standard analyzer
3. keyword analyzer:
	

4. simple analyzer :
	The simple analyzer breaks text into tokens at any non-letter character, such as numbers, spaces, hyphens and apostrophes, discards non-letter characters, and changes uppercase to lowercase.
	text = "The 2 QUICK Brown-Foxes jumped over the lazy dog's bone."
	then simple analyze produce [ the, quick, brown, foxes, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog, s, bone ]

5. whitespace analyzer :
	The whitespace analyzer breaks text into terms whenever it encounters a whitespace character.
	text = "this is working"
	then whitespace analyzer produce ["this","is","working"]
6. stop analyzer
7. 
Remember : For n-gram we use only index analyzer but not search analyzer
