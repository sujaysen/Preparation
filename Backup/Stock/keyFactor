Higher time frames (like daily) give you good understanding about strong support and 
resistance levels use them to increase your consistency.

Medium time frames(like hourly) are used for analysing price action and see if there 
is any momentum. Use Fibonacci, Gann levels, trend lines etc.

Lower time frames like 15 mins, 5 mins are used just to make sure you enter early and 
exit late and take the benefit of entire move.

Should take trade after 11 AM

All new traders should begin with a long-term approach

Dont use timeframe less than 5 min
