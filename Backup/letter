Respected sir/madam,
	My name is tapan kumar sen, an income tax payer with PAN BPYPS7904F.I filled ITR-1 for A.Y. 2021-22 and was processed on Dec 6,2021 but due
to incorrect/not valid bank account refund not processed. After that according to your guidelines I updated my bank account with valid one(PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK).But I am unable to set that account to active as getting refund. After few time contact with income tax customer care my issue not solved till now. 
According to customer executive I cleared all chache and cookies and open with different browser still facing same issue.

I requested to you please do the needful.I include the screenshots and PAN details.

Note :
	Following solutuon does not worked
		1. Cleared all cache and cookies
		2. Open with different browser
		3. Re-validate bank details 
		4. Unable to create refund reissue request

Thank You
