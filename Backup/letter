Respected sir/madam,
	My name is tapan kumar sen, an income tax payer with PAN BPYPS7904F.I filled itr1 for FY 2020-21 and was processed on 6th dec, 2021 but due
to incorrect/not valid bank account refund not processed. According to your guidelines I update my bank account with valid(PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK). \
But I am unable to set that accout to active as getting refund. After few time contact with income tax customer care my issue not solved till now. 
According to customer executive I cleared all chache and cookies and open with different browser still facing same issue.

I requested to you please do the needful.I include the screenshots and PAN details.

Note :
	Following solutuon does not worked
		1. Cleared all cache and cookies
		2. Open with different user
		3. Re-validate bank details
