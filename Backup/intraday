1. Never buy falling stocks and especially when the stock has crossed its resistance level because it can trap and give you big losses.
2. Buy those stocks which are taking support level and not coming down with the market but rising with the market, so that you will get a good return in that stock in intraday trading.
4.Tell me how does an Intraday chart of a company forms? How is a chart formed for a particular day? It is basically an extension of the previous day. Remember that it is always expected what happened yesterday will happen today in Intraday. So it is very important to analyse previous 2–3 days charts.
 
 Go to yahoo finance/google finance/investing.com or any site that shows you previous day's charts and see whether the stock has went up or down for some days. Normally,a script moves up or down for 2–3 days consistently after which it comes down. So, find stocks that have moved up just for 1 day. The scripts that have moved up/down 2–3 days are not of our concern. So just select those who have just just started moving up/down and had shown this trend for just 1 day.
